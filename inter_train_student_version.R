##########################

# a lot of intermediate data wrangling
# we may do a few minor graphs but the focus will be wrangling

# This course assumes a basic level of knowledge of R and dpylr
# It is expected that you are at least familiar with the contents of the 
# NHS-R Introduction to R and R Studio course

# in this tutorial we will be using modern |> pipes

# make a dataframe

# little bit of base R  - using $ sign to select a column
data$type

# get list of unique data items in a variable
unique(data$org_code)

# notice the bit of base R
# base R is useful for certain things and it is a good idea
# to understand some of the basics at how some of the things work
# The $ sign allows us to call a column of a data frame as a vector.
data$type

# it is also possible to to select a specific entry within that vector with 
# square brackets
# to call the 4th entry we can
data$type[4]

# we could also call the 4th to 10th entries
data$type[4:10]

# note to python users, we start counting at 1 and not zero
# we also include the 10th entry 
#  this is very different to how python does indexing

# get number of distinct entries
n_distinct(data$org_code)

# get the range of a variable (useful for dates)
range(data$period)

# see structure of data to check data types

  #
  # @param site The organizational code of the site you want to plot data for.
  # @param df (default = data) A data frame containing the attendance data.
  #        This data frame should have columns named `org_code`, `attendances`, 
  #        `period`, and `type`.
  #
  # @details This function filters the data frame based on the provided `site` 
  #          code. It then uses `ptd_spc` to calculate PTD values and improvement 
  #          direction (assumed to be decrease based on the code) for each 
  #          attendance type (`type`). Finally, it utilizes `ptd_create_ggplot` 
  #          to create the PTD ggplot with specific formatting options 
  #          (formatting options are assumed to be set in `ptd_create_ggplot`).
  #
  # @return A ggplot object representing the PTD for the specified site.
  #
  # @examples
  # 
  # Assuming you have data loaded in a data frame named 'data' containing 
  # columns 'org_code', 'attendances', 'period', and 'type', you can use the 
  # following code to generate a PTD plot for site 'ABC':
  #
  # plot_site("ABC", data)
  # This will display the ggplot object

# a loop is a element of that repeats a portion of code a desired number of 
# times
# often with an iteration of values or variables

# lets look at a simple sequence

seq(1:10)

# this gives us a simple sequence from one to ten
# we want to print out the sequence number plus 5

# we can make a loop to do this

for (i in seq(1, 10)) {          # traditionally variables in a loop start at i 
  # (they just do!)
  # what will happen is R will run the loop and for the first iteration 
  # i will be 1 and then 2 and then 3 etc 
  i_plus_five <- i + 5
  result <- paste0(i,' plus 5 equals ', i_plus_five)
  print(result)
}

# again with the curly brackets and scope
# a for loop does have global scope, if you look i_plus_five
# exists in the global environment, only with its last value
# it was over written each time time in the loop


# we can mess about with seq to come up with all sorts of number patterns

seq(50, nrow(data), 500)

# this makes a number sequence that starts at 50, ends at the number of rows in 
# our data (12765) and steps in increments of 500

# however the real magic starts is when we feed in a vector of data

vector <- c('Bob', 'Pete', 'Mary')

for (i in vector) {                 
  result <- paste0('Hello ', i)
  print(result)
}

# so now we can look at running our function but within a loop 
# almost that simple but we need to recall that a function can only return one 
# result
# we would really like to collate all of those results into one object
# we do this by utilising a list object
# a list object is a super special multi dimensional thing that can contain
# a mix of variables, dataframes, plot objects and any combination thereof

# we can not create a list from within our loop, otherwise we would be creating it
# blank on each iteration
# so lets make a blank list outside of our loop

plot_list <- list ()

# this is the vector we will feed to our loop
vector <- c('RQM', 'RJ1', 'RDD')

for (i in vector) {
  plot_list[i] <- plot_site(i)
}

# lets call some of our plots from the list
plot_list['RQM']

plot_list['RJ1']

# it is also possible to call the plot from its position in the list
plot_list[1]


# lets just say for example we wanted to run across all sites in a dynamic way
# we could create a vector of all the site names from the data

vector <- unique(data$org_code)

vector

# this does create a list 274 long and so lets not run it now, 
# but we could feed that into the loop if we really really wanted to
