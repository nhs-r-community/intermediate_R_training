data$type

# get list of unique data items in a variable
unique(data$type)

# notice the bit of base R
# base R is a useful for certain things and is its a good idea
# to understand some of the basics at how some of the things work
# The $ sign allows us to call a column of a data frame as a vector.
data$type

# it is also possible to to select a specific entry within that vector with square brackets
# this to call the 4th entry we can
data$type[4]

# we could also call the 4th to 10th entries
data$type[4:10]

# note to python users, we start counting at  1 and not zero
# we also include the 10th entry 
#  this is very different to how python does indexing

# get number of distinct entries
n_distinct(data$type)

# get the range of a variable (useful for dates)
range(data$period)

# see structure of data to check data types
